# Top 5 CVEs by Volume

## Variables

(No variables required for this prompt)

## Tools

- `armis-mcp`: Query CVE and vulnerability data from Armis

## MCP Query

Get the top 5 CVEs affecting the most devices in the environment. For each CVE include:
- CVE ID
- CVE description/title
- CVSS score and severity rating
- Number of affected devices
- Device types affected
- Any available remediation or patch information

Sort by the number of affected devices in descending order.

## Analysis Prompt

Based on the following CVE data retrieved from Armis, provide a prioritized vulnerability assessment focusing on the CVEs with the highest impact by device volume.

**CVE Data:**
{{data}}

## Required Analysis

1. **Top 5 CVEs Summary**: For each CVE, provide:
   - CVE ID and brief description
   - Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Total devices affected
   - Types of devices impacted

2. **Risk Prioritization**: Rank these CVEs by actual organizational risk considering:
   - Number of affected devices (exposure breadth)
   - CVSS score (technical severity)
   - Device criticality (servers vs. endpoints vs. IoT)
   - Exploitability (known exploits in the wild)

3. **Remediation Roadmap**: Provide actionable remediation steps:
   - Quick wins (patches available, easy deployment)
   - Medium-term fixes (requires planning/testing)
   - Long-term mitigations (for unpatched vulnerabilities)

4. **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentences summarizing the overall vulnerability posture based on these top CVEs.

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

### Top 5 CVEs by Device Count

| Rank | CVE ID | Severity | Affected Devices | Description |
|------|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | CVE-XXXX-XXXXX | Critical/High/Medium/Low | N devices | Brief description |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 3 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 4 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 5 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
